/**
 * @defgroup disposables Disposables
 *
 * @brief Disposable is handle/resource passed from observable to observer via
 * the `set_upstream` method. Observer disposes this disposable when it wants to
 * unsubscribe from observable.
 *
 * @details In reactive programming, a **disposable** is an object that
 * represents a resource that needs to be released or disposed of when it is no
 * longer needed. This can include things like file handles, network
 * connections, or any other resource that needs to be cleaned up after use. The
 * purpose of a disposable is to provide a way to manage resources in a safe and
 * efficient manner. By using disposables, you can ensure that resources are
 * released in a timely manner, preventing memory leaks and other issues that
 * can arise from resource leaks.
 *
 * There are 2 main purposes of disposables:
 * 1. **Upstream disposable** <br>
 * This is a disposable that the observable puts into the observer.
 * The upstream disposable keeps some state or callback that should be disposed
 * of when the observer is disposed (== no longer wants to receive emissions,
 * for example, was completed/errored or just unsubscribed) This ensures that
 * any resources used by the observable are properly cleaned up when the
 * observer obtains on_error/on_completed or disposed in any other way.
 *
 * 2. **External disposable** <br>
 * This is a disposable that allows the observer to be disposed of from outside
 * the observer itself. This can be useful in situations where you need to
 * cancel an ongoing operation or release resources before the observable has
 * completed its work. To achieve this in rpp you can pass disposable to
 * `subscribe` method or use `subscribe_with_disposable` overload instead.
 *
 * @note In rpp all disposables should be created via @link
 * rpp::disposable_wrapper_impl @endlink instead of manually.
 *
 * @warning From user of rpp library it is not really expected to handle
 * disposables manually somehow **except** of case where user want to control
 * lifetime of observable-observer connection manually.
 *
